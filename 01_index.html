        <h2>Experience of a Sea Voyage</h2>
        <p>
            In this summer vaccation I got an opportunity to go to Puri for about a week with my family. We 
            stayed in a hotel which was within a walking distance from the sea. The next day after reching, my father
            hired a boat for two hours. The boat was not so large but quite spacious. We started enjoying the journey 
            in the refreshing sea breeze. It was the dusk and the Sun had just set down. The scenery was very beautiful
            and I took a lot of photographes. There were other boats on the sea sailing side by side with ours. We were 
            about to take the snacks and at that time suddenly a huge wave scared us all. After having almost one hour 
            of journey we decided to return back. Even after getting back to the hotel I was wandering about the journey.
            At night, I wrote down my first experience of sea voyage into my diary. The memory was wonderful that I'll be
            able to remember it for a long period of time.
